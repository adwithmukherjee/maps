2. We are also able to get the app to return a bunch of entries by using SELECT * statements and inserting truthy values like OR 1=1.

3. To ensure that SQL injections can't run on our software, we'd parse the inputs for SQL operations. Breaking operations include 'DROP', 'DELETE',
'SELECT,' equals signs, and quotation marks. I would avoid allowing any user direct access to the text of a SQL query entirely.
